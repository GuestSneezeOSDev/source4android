Source4Android is an open-source, base mod for Half-Life 2 which allows players to port their mods to Android and Android-based systems without using any leaked code.
# How to build.
Firstly, you will need to install build dependencies[[1]](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013#Step_One:_Getting_the_basic_C/C++_development_tools), here are the required packages.
- If you're on Arch Linux or any pacman-based run
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel gcc dpkg
```
- If you're on Debian or any APT-Based distro run
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib # For x86_64
sudo apt-get install build-essential # For x86/i386
```
Download the Steam Client Runtime and copy the files from this repo to there.
<br>
Now you will need to run the `buildandroid.sh` file located in `src/` directory.
```bash
cd source4android/src/
./buildandroid.sh
```
Now build the makefile
```bash
make -f [MAKEFILE].mak
```

# Troubleshooting
if you get this output:
```bash
creating: source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/
  inflating: source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/cp.m4
  inflating: source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/eilseq.m4
  inflating: source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/endian.m4
  inflating: source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/general.m4
  inflating: source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/libtool.m4
source4android-main/src/thirdparty/libiconv-1.15/m4/libtool.m4:  write error (disk full?).  Continue? (y/n/^C)
```
then you do not have enough diskspace. Clear some storage [Guide for Debian.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/5980/how-do-i-free-up-disk-space), [Guide for other distro's](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/774199/how-to-clean-up-a-linux-system-to-free-up-disk-space)
